Research software can be challenging to distribute, install, and configure in the cloud, especially when viewed through the lens of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible). CACAO (Cloud Automation Continuous Analysis Orchestration) is a multi-cloud platform designed to help research software engineers distribute their software in a FAIR way. It also provides educational and research users with a user interface to effortlessly deploy research software into any cloud. CACAO orchestrates cloud infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, or Kubernetes templates. These templates can install and configure anything from a single virtual machine, storage, or container to a more complex set of cloud resources, such as a Zero To Jupyterhub using Kubernetes.

This talk will help you understand how to use CACAO on Jetstream, whether youâ€™re a research software engineer, educator, or researcher.
